That’s the reason we, along with our natural environment, everything is in huge danger. People perform and participate several activities in saving the environment and it’s all associated natural resources but, when it comes to the implementation of some initiatives that lead to saving the environment, people either steps back or do not make an initiate. </p><br />\r\n<strong>If this would be going to remain the still then, how would the things go to work? </strong><br />\r\n<p>So, such initiatives are good to make but collectively, we need to save our environment because the time has already begun when we are supposed to pay for water and fresh oxygen. </p><br />\r\n<p>How amazing is this that the basic two natural and important resources have become so polluted by human blunders that now we have to pay for fresh mineral water and purified oxygen to inhale. So, being the residents of the earth, irrespective of any colour, caste, creed, belief or religion collectively, we are required to take an action. Henceforth, all of us is required to boost and powered up the methodologies towards environment management with brainstorming strategies so that no penny should be paid for any natural resources. Seriously, this is a huge as well as an alarming concern if natural resources are required to be paid which anyone could have ever imagined. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Well, nothing surprising because it\'s we only who is responsible for the same. </strong><br />\r\n<p>Ranging from the festival lights to attending air travel, events for environment management comprise of a broader energy appetite. People feel it on the bottom line when it comes to the power drops inclusive the surcharges of airline fuel and generators. Owing to this, it has drastically resulted in the planet’s resource exploration, emissions and has also limited its development. Thus, implementing green power solutions have immensely become an essential and efficient pathway for energy and resource conservation.</p> <br />\r\n<p>Additionally, initiating such responsibilities must include the below-mentioned pointers: <br/><br />\r\n1.<b>Reduction:</b> Reduction in terms of an environment fundamentally focusses on the appropriate use of energy and resources, carbon emissions and all associated cost. <br/><br />\r\n2.<b>Efficiency:</b> As the term itself suggests efficiency, it majorly means preventing the energy which is unnecessarily getting waste. Prevention ad saving of energy would automatically lead to cost-cutting and cost-saving. <br/> <br />\r\n3.<b>Innovation:</b> To come up with new ideologies that strive its best in proving the energy-saving solutions. <br/><br />\r\n4.<b> Engagement:</b> To participate more and more in the environment saving practices driving more of the saving of resources overconsumption. <br/><br />\r\n5.<b>Accountability:</b> A blend of appropriate usage of natural & environmental resources. </p><br />\r\n<p>Alongside this, when it comes to the reduction in the energy consumption, there are again some measures that are required to be taken into the consideration and could drive the best out of the box results such as: <br/><br />\r\n1.<b>Green energy destinations:</b> It just needs to be explored. Every destination comprises of some unique energy profile wherein, some regions still require more and more greenery and energy sourcing. <br/><br />\r\n2.<b>Green energy venues:</b> Explore the destinations that are not much blessed with the low-emissions components. Here is the best step to make a move. Try to explore the venue where more and more sources of renewable energy could be adopted both by the place and the people. <br/><br />\r\n3.<b>Responsible transportation:</b> Both practically and ideally, green-minded environmental practices could easily avoid additional use of energy majorly when it comes to transportation and commuting by designing walkable, cycle-able and transit-accessible vehicles. On the other hand, if such components don’t seem possible to have or avail at the respective moment then, try to find out the hybrid or electric vehicles inclusive of biodiesel as well. <br/><br />\r\n4.<b>Portable generation:</b> To adopt portable generation mostly prove to reduce the energy load over your power generator. Such form of initiative pertaining to generators result in the least polluting and makes the least noise. <br/><br />\r\nHenceforth, the safety of the environment is in our hands only, the more we conserve it, the more we would be able to reserve the resources for the upcoming time.

Within seconds the incessant coughing began, my eyes watered and a shooting headache gripped me.</p>   \r\n<p>   \r\nOne didn’t even need to switch on the news to <span>confirm what I instinctively knew: Delhi had turned into a gas chamber - with poisonous gases 70 times the permissible limit! And I was in the heart of it.</span></p>   \r\n<p>   \r\nWhile the better off amongst us followed doctors’ orders to stay indoors, wear masks and buy <span>expensive indoor air purifiers, millions of others suffered a more miserable fate. I’m referring to the underprivileged, the homeless who can’t afford these luxuries, people who need</spam> to be on the move for work and infants, children and the elderly whose immune systems are weaker. #RightToBreathe</p>   \r\n<p>   \r\nMasks and purifiers are jugaad (quick-fixes). They don’t solve the problem. They delay doom. What we need are sustainable, long-term solutions. Our government - the people we elected to protect our well-being are the ones who - should be finding a way out. And fast.</p>   \r\n<p>   \r\nBut instead what we saw playing out in the news was a blame game. One state blaming another. “Stop your farmers from burning rubble”. “No, you people need to curb vehicular pollution.” “Go regulate construction dust first”.</p>   \r\n<p>   \r\nFrankly, I don’t care who did what and why. Neither do the majority of citizens in North India who are suffering this blanket killer smog year after year.</p>   \r\n<p>   \r\nThe time for finger-pointing is now long gone. It’s time for the 5 states most affected by toxic air in North India to work together like the 5 fingers on our hands. They are Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.</p>   \r\n<p>This issue should be topmost for the leadership of all NCR states.</p>   \r\n<p>   \r\nBecause toxic air harms everyone. It doesn’t distinguish between the lungs of ministers and common citizens, Punjabi farmers or Delhi car owners.</p>   \r\n<p>   \r\nI’ve started my petition asking the top political parties to  “Create a 5-state policy to tackle air pollution in NCR”  This, in addition to whatever emergency measures need to be taken to tackle the ongoing situation.</p>   \r\n<p>Clean air matters much more to us citizens than votes do to politicians. So I hope the 5 states rise above the petty politics and work in sync.</p>   \r\n<p>   \r\n<span>   \r\nSign and share my petition if you believe you have a right to clean air today.    \r\n</span> \r\n</p>  ',	0,	0,	0,	1000,	2,	'2019-11-05 07:07:15',	'2019-12-10 10:43:19'),

According to the<br />\r\ngovernment’s data, Ujjwala Scheme targeted 5 Cr.

It has observed that BPL families have claimed that they are unable to<br />\r\nafford LPG refills. <br />\r\nScheme Launched: for People Welfare or Votes Bagging? <br />\r\nHowever, the Ujjwala Scheme was launched for bagging of votes during elections<br />\r\nwith a promise that each rural woman of below poverty line household would be<br />\r\nfacilitated with the same but unfortunately, because of the high cost of LPG refills<br />\r\nthey saw a major dud. The strategy of acquiring the bulk votes was quite interesting<br />\r\nas it focussed on BPL household visits while sitting on the muddy floor and eating<br />\r\nthe meal cooked on the earthen stove or Chulhas. <br />\r\nHowever, to get the LPG cylinder under this scheme the BPL family woman required<br />\r\nto fill a form provided by the respective gas agency while paying the subsidized price<br />\r\nof ? 1750 otherwise without such scheme it would be costing ? 2950. <br />\r\nA Curse or A Cause<br />\r\nPeople of such families did enjoy the scheme until the time the cylinder doesn’t<br />\r\nrequire the refill. With the passing away of the gas, they again came back to the<br />\r\nChulhas using kerosene oil and other kinds of solid fuels. The emitted smoke from<br />\r\nsuch substances led to hazardous health issues. Moreover, as per the World Health<br />\r\nOrganisation, worldwide, 3.8 million people die because of the smoke exposure from<br />\r\nthe dirty stoves. Also, the stats obtained from WHO quoted that in India, 4,88,200<br />\r\ndeaths occur every year just because of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<br />\r\n(COPD), ischaemic heart disease, due to pneumonia, lung cancer, and stroke. Also,<br />\r\n8 complete years are lost amid 1,000 people majorly because of the indoor air<br />\r\npollution wherein, the most affected people are the children and the woman. <br />\r\nSaving Wealth or Losing Health <br />\r\nBoth the Indian societies as well as the government need to understand that cooking<br />\r\non Chulhas renders a huge number of fumes and smog which adversely affect the<br />\r\nenvironment then, how a human being can remain unaffected from the same? If,<br />\r\nUjjwala Scheme has been properly implemented focusing on the low cost of the gas<br />\r\nrefill then, it could have successfully helped the sufferers which they have been<br />\r\nfacing because of the constant use of Chulhas. <br />\r\nThe use of Chulhas adversely affects human health that it can cause a loss of vision,<br />\r\nlungs problem, inhaling or other breathing problems and a lot more than one can<br />\r\never imagine. For your safeguard, you need to take any action while not fully relying<br />\r\non government schemes. However, the government must support people with the<br />\r\nproper implementation of such schemes. It must organize the schemes that it may<br />\r\nnot affect the people for a shorter time span, in fact, help them in solving all their<br />\r\ndaily hurdles. <br />\r\nOne Initiative is Essential<br />\r\nThe people of such areas are out of the reach of a flourished money, so they feel<br />\r\nthemselves helpless.

Also, as per the government concerns, it<br />\r\nshould have set up the reasonable prices of gas refilling that people from Chulhas<br />\r\nmay move towards the LPG. This would surely bring a positive effect on society and<br />\r\nthe economy. <br />\r\nAgain, the concluded reason states that the unaffordability of LPG cylinders is the<br />\r\ncore concern of using Chulhas with the help of cow dung and coal that are easily<br />\r\naccessible. Else, in the fastest running era of the technology where Gas Stove is<br />\r\nbeing also replaced by the Electronic Induction, who wants to cook food on the<br />\r\nburning wood emitting fumes. The Government needs to reduce the prices of gas<br />\r\nrefilling that no house may remain left with the LPG cylinders. <br />\r\nPeople must also know the worth and importance of their health and time which is<br />\r\nbeing wasted sitting in front of Chulhas.',	0,	0,	0,	2000,	2,	'2019-12-03 12:27:01',	'2019-12-04 12:32:24'),

Moreover, the prices are expected to soar more by the end of February 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Triggering of Unseasonable Rainfall led Crop Damage  </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prices of onion have risen drastically in all over the country. The reason behind the rising cost is unseasonal rain as well as the shortage of onion crop. Also, the worst part is that the rising cost has not even benefited a single farmer instead they have complained that none of the onion crops has been fetched because of its poor quality. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Increasing Consumption led to Decreasing Requirements </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In accordance with some sophisticated sources, in India, the monthly consumption of onions was 15 lakh metric tons which shows a requirement of 50 thousand metric tons. But, with the high cost, the daily supply has become 10-12%, as of now. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Appeal to Government – a Solution for a Common Man</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people and other associated welfare bodies have asked the government to create onion’s buffer stock, distribution of the staple at a reasonable cost, a crackdown on the hoarding of onion’s traders, etc just to relief a middle class and a common man. Onion as a staple of each kitchen in every household has affected not only the general public but a huge mass of farmers as well. Indian farmers have emotionally expressed a painful concern because most of them are distributing the old stock of onion because of the damaging of new onions. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just because the wholesale market has seen a huge spike in the cost, it has simultaneously affected the resulting market as well. Wherein, this sharper jump is restricting the public to make a hole in their pockets. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nationwide surge in the spike of onion price has affected most of the Indian states and cities such as Pune, Maharashtra, Chennai, Mumbai, Odisha, West Bengal, Kolkata, Delhi and a lot more. Therein, it has affected the market chain by affecting both the sellers and consumers in buying an onion. Nevertheless, daily consumers are unfortunately are forced to reduce their purchases and are cooking their delicious food as – onion free. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Battlefield between State & Central Government </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, the worst condition expressed by the farmers is the rotten onion which can neither be used nor purchased and can only get wasted by throwing and dumping it in the dustbins. Most of the citizens have appealed to the Central Government to take impactful immediate actions but, the tussle amid the state and the central government is affecting the common man, alas!!! </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Onion’s Robbery at Dusk’s Early Hours </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the robbery of goods that can benefit you in any ground has been seen and observed in several different cases. But, have you ever heard of Onion’s robbery. Could you ever imagine that onions can also be getting stolen? Sounds funny; but, it’s true, 250kg onions worth ?2500 have been stolen from Gujarat vegetable shop during the early hours of dawn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Government in Jitters & Public in Tears </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such a looming onion crisis has put the government in jitters as well as the general public in tears. Therein, huge strata focussing on several households, cafes, and restaurants have been affected adversely. In short, this food inflation has made the entire nation cry where people are left with no choice just to maintain a cost-cutting for onion. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Indian Government must enlighten the issue and should immediately take the concern into consideration. This is because the continuous spike in the price is neither good for the country and nor for the Indian traders and farmers who are stagnantly witnessing a great fall in the onion demand.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Onion, with which every food tastes tasteless, is now getting reduced from the daily menus, dishes, and salads. However, to avoid the further disruption of the onion trade in the country, the government has placed orders for 6,090 tonnes of onions from Egypt to prevent India from Onion’s Crisis. This initiative would somewhere support the daily income of Indian farmers. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hope so, fresh and quality harvest may sooner hit the Indian market vanishing food inflation at its best.</p>\r\n',	0,	0,	0,	2000,	2,	'2019-12-06 05:32:46',	'2019-12-10 10:15:27'),

Most of the people from the age of 18 and above apply for the government vacancy with a hope that one day they may get a chance of having complete job security. Contradicting to this, again for a smaller number of vacancies, a huge number of people apply nationwide wherein, a few get a chance of selection.  <p>  \r\n    \r\n<strong>Employing the Unemployed has become an Occupation</strong>   \r\n<p>\r\nAlso, employing unemployed people has become a business. Most of the people play fraudulent activities with the name of branded organization and promise to unemployed ones providing a job with complete security. When a jobseeker gets influenced by the fraudsters, they ask for money. If a person gives the quoted amount then, these fraudsters run away leaving behind a no clue of their identification. </p>\r\n<p>    \r\nNo one knows where a nation will go if this would be continuing the way it is. Also, in the era of technology as well as digitalization, Information Technology (IT) domain is phasing the rough period of streamlining cost majorly concentrating on the employees of mid to senior level. Undoubtedly, this would further take the nation on the highest toll of unemployment in the next coming quarters.

The nation is in the hope that no rape case may take place and no girl crossing on the road becomes a victim.

Does the launch of the campaign “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” seriously saving the girl child or have just taken for granted?</p> <br />\r\n<p>However, not every state in India prohibits or violates this yojana because awareness regarding the protection as well as education of girl child has immensely helped in improving the ratio of child sex abuse in the state like Haryana. Still, it\'s not just gotten restricted to Haryana because India needs much more improvement in the context of Girl Child. </p><br />\r\n<p>According to some renowned sources, going back to 2011 (eight years ago), in the district like Jhajjar, no one could ever imagine giving birth to a girl. Also, as per the 2011 Census, Jhajjar considered the worst district in terms of Child Sex Ratio and was also listed on the top as the worst-performing district. After Jhajjar, the district like Rewari and Kurukshetra came next in such context.</p> <br />\r\n<p>The country’s only motto is to lead its citizens with the great zeal towards each era including the girl child. Thus, it is mandatory to improve and promote gender equality wherein, since 2015, PM Narendra Modi’s launched Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana from Sonipat has a bit effected the people. </p><br />\r\n<p>Since the conceptualization as well as the launch of this campaign, awareness regarding education and protecting the girl child has been increased. But, only the initiative from the government’s ends or no other government policies would work until the people would start taking initiative on their own. </p><br />\r\n<p>Since 2019, according to the sources, it has seen that a CSR of 1,647:1000 is found in Dighal village wherein, it is doing much better in raising voice against child sex abuse in compliance with its other neighbouring villages.</p> <br />\r\n<p>Also, as per the societal point of view, still today there exists a lot of people whose mindsets have changed towards gender biases and gender equality. Not everyone is feminist and not everyone abuses child sex. Today’s present generation doesn’t find and judge anything wrong or exceptional in having a baby girl. This is because, in almost all fields today, ranging from personal to professional ones, girls dominate everywhere. </p><br />\r\n<p>On the other hand, still, the majority of the older generation believe in stereotypes and strive their best in resisting the present generation to have a girl over a boy. Somewhere somehow still the fact exists in the society that having a first baby as a girl people prefer to have a boy as a second. Slowly or sooner things need to change and that definitely would bring the best outcomes in the upcoming years. </p><br />\r\n<p>However, the fundamental purpose to launch Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana was to watch over the places and people who had involved themselves in the practices of using prenatal scanning or female infanticide to know the baby’s sex before his birth or within the female’s womb.</p> <br />\r\n<p>In addition to this, as per the press release of 2018’s state government, it has observed that the sex ratio is the year 2016 was 871 girls for 1,000 boys which improved to 900 girls per 1,000 boys in the year 2017. The number has been improvised because of the actions taken by the people such as FIRs against child sex abuse, awareness programs and raids at suspected ultrasound centres. </p><br />\r\n<p>Alongside the initiative taken by the local citizens, the state health department also acted as the watchdogs over the centres conducting prenatal sex determination tests. For more of the awareness, one strongly needs to educate every girl in his family with a core objective focusing on gender determination which is illegal and on sexual biases as well. Gender equality must be all above in all the eras of one\'s life. This is because a boy or a girl is one\'s personal choice to make but not a societal decision to adopt. </p><br />\r\n ',	0,	0,	0,	1500,	2,	'2019-12-10 11:23:27',	'2019-12-12 09:57:58'),

But, this also needs to be understood by the society that marriage is not only about physical love, sex or romance. If in any married relationship, without considering the tenure of the wedding, if your spouse especially your wife is not ready or prepared for physical love and you are forcing her to have that attention then, unfortunately, you are raping her, martially. </p><br />\r\n<strong>What Marital Rape states?</strong> <br />\r\n<p>To force a woman for physical love and attention without her permission in a marital relationship is known as Marital Rape. </p><br />\r\n<p>Talking about the Marital Rape, Narendra Modi’s government destabilizes the institution of marriage which could also act as a weapon to harass husbands. The government needs to understand and discover a stronger correlation amid saving the marriage institution as well as criminalizing marital rape. It’s a matter of concern that how difficult it could be getting a raped by a husband. From a societal point of view, this is not a big deal and is an obvious point but, for a female, this is nothing less than a brutal rape when she is not prepared and is not willing for physical love. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Just because you’re married so, forceful sex is okay</strong><br />\r\n<p>In India, there seem a lot of females who are a victim of the marital rape and continuously appeal for the justice but there is no hearing in the eyes of law, in the grounds of court and, in fact, in front of families. This is so because everyone seems that a couple is married so sex is official and is okay but, the concern gets over neglected that whether a person is willing or not without noticing that it’s a married couple. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Woman – a subject for sex, machine producing babies and idol of romance</strong><br />\r\n<p>Additionally, as per the societal point of view, in marital sex, a reasonable person is always a male wherein, a woman always ends up as a device of baby-making as well as an idol of romance. A typical marital rapist is the one who still believes that a woman can be ruled and dominated as per his will and choice. Also, he feels that in sexual matters if he wants sex then, she should be glad and if she isn’t then, a man has a complete right to force her. Overall this shows that he is an object and a lady is a sexual subject to play or mold with. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Feminism majorly exists in male dominating society</strong> <br />\r\n<p>Still today, the society is somewhere male-dominant where being feminist is not wrong. Thus, in such a male dominant society woman’s struggle is not only limited but reasonable as well. All man seriously needs to understand that a woman is not a sexual property. Marital rape is a crime that everyone including the government should need to understand and must enlighten the same very seriously.</p><br />\r\n <br />\r\n ',	0,	0,	0,	3500,	2,	'2019-12-16 05:34:16',	'2019-12-20 11:34:54'),

In fact, it is natural that an organization is motivated only with its motivated employees. In the hustle bustle of the competitive era where everyone is a player to win the organizational race, managers of the firm must focus both on the financial rewards and employees motivation as well. </p><br />\r\n<p>However, sometimes employee’s motivation using rewards becomes intimidating for the managers. This should not happen because when your work culture is armed with the correct and appropriate information and tactics then why would managers feel daunt in enhancing the motivation of his employees using rewards in no time. The managers who always develop and revamp the employee rewards program must concentrate on some of the most mandatory aspects. </p><br />\r\n<strong>This article would tell you in brief… </strong><br />\r\n<p>Employees Involvement in the implementation of a rewards program would work better because this would encourage them interacting amid all the staff no matter senior or junior. Doing so would also ensure that the upper management including all the employees is on board with the organization’s reward system.</p> <br />\r\n<p>On the contrary, it should be noticeable that employee’s involvement in such programs is a worthy effort. The managers must always value the inputs provided by them irrespective of their designation, experience and age and then, select rewards accordingly. Owing to this, the employees who see worthy efforts in rewards will always feel motivated and would often act proactively.</p> <br />\r\n<p>It’s also important on the part of managers to assure that how employees can also comprehend to earn rewards. Involving them in the programs and valuing their inputs must not be restricted. However, managers should clearly explain to them how they can earn rewards. This is because, when your employees would be having a transparent understanding of expectations then, they will be capable enough of achieving the same. <br/><br />\r\nOn the contrary, employees must also establish transparent and reasonable performance standards to achieve rewards. This would lead them to engage the necessary efforts as expected or sometimes beyond expectations. Thus, managers must check in with the employees assuring that the rewards are near to their reach. Additionally, assisting the employees with a relevant dashboard via which they could observe their daily, weekly or monthly performance in real-time as per their assigned task. This is because; this would also allow them to have proper access to their tasks and performances in order to have realistic expectations for the expected rewards. </p><br />\r\n<p> Also, it\'s genuine on the manager’s part which employees should also understand that rewards are always based on the determination of the objective performance data. This is because, when the rewards get served based on the same then, more likely, employees feel no biases in the process and generate a right understanding of what is expected from them. Unbiased or fair judgment always fills employees with great motivation, enthusiasm, passion, and zeal towards the work. </p><br />\r\n<p>Assuring that employees are served with the unbiased reward system abreast with the fair distribution would encourage them to obtain more rewards simultaneously would generate more productivity. Also, it must be taken into consideration that engaging in cutting corners or favoritism will render a detrimental impact on the performance of the employees. Whereas, linking rewards to the performance would influence employees leaving a positive impact. Owing to such practices, the employees would be able to see the complete transparency in the work culture, organizational environment and would also apprehend the connection amid their rewards and performance. Thus, all of them will be automatically get motivated to optimally perform in the near future. </p><br />\r\n<p>In accordance with the met expected milestones, employees must be rewarded ensuring that they have fairly received the recognition for their progress including the consistency in their behavior as per the company’s expectations. In such a case, it’s better to discover the team based incentives because this could be effective enough to make employees passionate and enthusiast towards the work simultaneously would lead in increasing both the performance and productivity. However, if an organization doesn’t work on team-based rewards then, it must include it in its rewards program where devoted resources to team-based rewards must be substantial. Such a practice would surely go to leave a significant impact on employee’s cohesiveness as well as cooperation.<br/> <br />\r\nOn the contrary, there could also be a fatal flaw of not rewarding the top performers thusly, a good performer should never be taken for granted in order to maintain and flourish the top talent not only in the team but also in the organization. So, timely acknowledgment of rewards on excellent performance is a must. </p><br />\r\n<p>However, there is also some certain factor associated with maintenance of top talents which becomes obvious and natural after some point in time. This gets showcased when an employee makes it his behavioral habit. Hence, the managers should not offer the non-monetary rewards and recognition despite financial rewards which must be distributed depending on the variable ratio. </p><br />\r\n<p>It all depends on how well employees perform and at what extent does he dedicate himself. This could believe that long-term reward programs leave a positive effect on the overall performance leading to generate the long-lasting results.

As per the judgement, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court without opposition rule stated that having a sexual relationship with a female without her husband’s knowledge was a criminal offence. On the contrary, as stated above, it has been unconstitutional and has not been accepted by the people to an extent. </p><br />\r\n<p><b>Section 497 of the Indian penal code states that adultery law must be gender-neutral as it could become an obstacle against a spouse abandoning their respective families.</b> This concern majorly applies to the rural areas where most of the families still live in the oldest tradition and have stereotype mindsets.

In other words, a baby is born with proper planning or just gets an accidental birth. This article would tell the real meaning, importance, benefits, advantages and almost everything associated with family planning.</p><br />\r\n<p>Before going in detail, just enlighten the history and some facts and findings of family planning as stated and quoted by the International Conference on Human Rights since 1968.</p><br />\r\n<p> In accordance with the conference, family planning is globally affirmed human right which is not limited to a married couple but applies to the entire members of a family, irrespective of the gender. As per the document released by the conference which is also called Teheran Proclamation, it clearly states that <b>“Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children.”</b></p><br />\r\n<p>On the other hand, it is also important to note that, India being the vast population country, one can’t overlook the implications of population explosion. Therein, over the last couple of years, the population growth is found on the urge to exceed more and more, by and far. Additionally, it is also notable that this urge of the population has reached to the surge due to the contributions of socio-economic culture and conditions, historical facts, policy changes and a lot more. </p><br />\r\n<p>Thus, people of the country are requested to deliver a limited as well as a planned baby which would help in the contribution of the quality population whilst population growth and control. </p><br />\r\n<p> Therefore, for a purpose of upholding a right quality family planning, people should concentrate on the below-mentioned parameters that are required to be implemented, monitored and regulated for the healthy changes in the concerning family planning.</p><br />\r\n<strong>No Gender Biasness</strong><br />\r\n<p> Family Planning including all the concerns associated with it must not be restricted to any sex, caste, creed, race, gender, religions, political views, language, nationality, economic status, native place, marital status, disability status etc. Doing so could result in ‘n’ numbers of mental trauma inside the person expecting to have a newborn. </p><br />\r\n<strong> Awareness</strong><br />\r\n<p> Coming to the precautions and contraceptive pills, proper information, awareness and knowledge must be circulated to everyone without hesitations. Sex education is necessary especially when it comes to serious concerns like Family Planning. Thus, sex education should be available to everyone at the right age and time based on the fractioning needs, differentiating factors and some little barriers associated with the same. Hence, it becomes exceptionally essential to understand the information’s quality depending on the background, education and health infrastructure. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Hassle-Free Implementation of Ideologies for Family Planning </strong><br />\r\n<p>When it comes to the implementation and formulation of the entire guidelines in the context of the <b>family planning</b>, there must not be a lack of access towards the hassle-free implementation. Here, access means the level and depth of rigor pertaining to accessibility and affordability. Herein, both the physical accessibility as well as affordability is the two major components that must be taken into consideration while thinking of expanding your generation or family. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Healthy Acceptance of Contraceptives </strong><br />\r\n<p>While intimacy and <strong>another discussion of family planning</strong>, it is highly suggestible to properly make use of contraceptive products that too in a dignified way while respecting the modern ways of medical policies and ethics as well. </p><br />\r\n<strong>No hide and seek in communication</strong><br />\r\n<p> While having a discussion about other members of the family pertaining to the concerns and issues of family planning, proper communication with respect to everyone’s acceptance and ideologies must be respected. This is so because; a small idea or view of any family member could guide a spouse towards the right ways. Thus, clear communication is necessary without pressurizing and provoking anyone. Moreover, coming to the contraceptive commodities, it must be purchased and rendered by sophisticated sanitary personnel. </p><br />\r\n<strong> Informed & Mutual Decisions </strong><br />\r\n<p> A family doesn’t restrict to the spouse and parents instead while panning a baby, most of the relations start getting connected with each other and with a baby as well before his or her birth in the world. So, while thinking of the <b>family planning</b>, each member of the family must be informed well enough reflecting free misrepresentation of the views and personal relationship. Herein, contraceptive counseling essentially becomes comprehensive equipping members to apprehend their decisions.</p><br />\r\n<strong> Not Disclosing the Maternity Matters </strong><br />\r\n<p>Best and healthy treatment is the most crucial factor to attain during family planning and other further processes of the same. Therefore, maintaining complete confidentiality, privacy and security in the treatment and other decisions must be locked amid the doctors, health workers, co-staff and other members as well. This is so because, there are a lot of people who visit the maternity centers every day, disclosing the patient’s history would affect all in making effective decisions for planning a baby. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Women Involvement with no Forceful Decisions </strong><br />\r\n<p>While planning a family to conceive and deliver a baby, at last, it’s the woman only who has to deliver a baby. Thus, this must be ensured that the woman who becomes the recipient for family planning should be well prepared when it comes to the development spheres influencing her decision and other health measures. Additionally, when it comes to the policies concerning reproductive and sexual health, family planning must be called from an educational and healthy point of views involving gynecologists, doctors, and other co-working staff members.<br/><br />\r\nImperative accountability must be reflected in the massive family members majorly by doctors, sex educators, and lifestyle specialists, health personnel majorly including family doctors, physicians and gynecologists etc. in order to maintain a high standard of accountability.

Most often these robbers either carry a pair of extra jacket or shirt with them and always apply some lubricated substances on their body so that, if they get cached by someone they could easily slip and can run away. After acquiring the stolen goods, these robbers sell the desired products and earn their desirable profits. </p><br />\r\n<p>Their smooth escaping practice makes them difficult to trace whereas, surveillance of CCTV sometimes could help to an extent.

This is actually so because the word epidemic itself comprises of a huge meaning in its existence. An epidemic could be anything which begins with a small symptom and later turns into a big disease and hence is termed <b>as Epidemic</b>.</p>\r\n<p>These days, the same is happening in the case of Coronavirus. However, people are getting various information and facts regarding the virus and hence, is listed as the infodemic.<br/>\r\nAs the Coronovirus is rapidly increasing in the major countries of the world wherein, China has been hugely tapped by it. The virus has been s threatening and has proven to be life taking amid the people that everyone fears with its name. The major issue is the recognition of the same i.e. how to analyse and diagnose that whether a person is suffering from some illness is either Coronavirus or something else. So, the symptoms and diagnosis of the virus are mentioned below: <br/>\r\n· Fever <br/>\r\n· Cough <br/><br />\r\n· Shortness of breath  <br/>\r\n· Runny Nose <br/>\r\n· Headache  <br/>\r\n· Sore Throat <br/>\r\nThough such symptoms are found to be very common and can be easily cured but in case of such virus, these symptoms should not be overlooked as it has caused a large number of deaths these days in just the couple of days. Thus, for confirmed, 2019-nCoV infections have reported a severe illness leading death. </p>\r\n<p>It is also believed that the symptoms of 2019-nCoV may appear either in 2 days or as long as in 14 days. Also, it is entirely based on the incubation period of the MERS virus. Apart from such noticeable symptoms, it also includes some other symptoms as well such as 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. All such symptoms generally caused some upper-respiratory tract illnesses majorly in the context of common cold, pneumonia or bronchitis. However, such illness is basically found in the people suffering from cardiopulmonary disease and the people with the weaker immune system. </p>\r\n<p> In addition to this, one should also enlighten that the other two associated symptoms of Coronavirus i.e. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have also become frequently familiar with the people resulting in life-ending happenings. With the sufferings of such virus, approx. 3-4 people out of 10 have been sentenced to death on almost frequent hourly intervals. </p>\r\n<strong>What precautions one should take for avoidance and prevention of Coronavirus? </strong>\r\n•    Frequent hand washing with alcohol-based hand wash or liquid soap as it would help in killing the germs and virus. <br/>\r\n•    Maintain respiratory hygiene. This would be only performed while covering both face and mouth with tissue paper or handkerchief mainly while coughing and sneezing. Doing so would help in preventing the germs and virus and could contaminate the objects or people you come into contact with. <br/>\r\n•    Stop touching your mouth, face, nose and eyes because touching such surfaces could result in virus contamination. Touching such parts may result in virus transferring immensely and exceptionally. <br/>\r\n•    Avoid consuming animal’s products (all forms of non-veg) and stop being into contact with the animals like camel, rats, cats, rodents, birds, bats and dogs as well. <br/>\r\n<p>Therefore, the diagnosis of such symptoms has been essentially required to save people from the massively growing epidemic all around the clock. Your doctors and other health care providers should examine you by performing some of the laboratory tests on respiratory specimens all the major blood test (called serum) in order to detect the presence of Coronavirus if any. If you found the test with positive results, then, you must immediately contact your doctor informing him about your recent travelling, non-veg intake and animal’s contact. A large number of MERS-CoV infections has been detected from Arabian Peninsula’s country and so, it becomes highly essential to note and report about your travel diaries and history or animal’s contact. Herein, animal contact fundamentally means with contact with camel or camel diaries and products.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, if you are suffering from fever, cough and cold then, you should immediately pay <br />\r\nattention to the same before it becomes serious or life-taking. </p>',	0,	0,	0,	10000,	2,	'2020-02-05 11:30:56',	'2020-03-02 12:32:03'),

However, as per the political scenarios, there have been 3 concerned contests amid Congress, Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).

However, the final result will be declared on Feb 11. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Vote has a deeper meaning and value </strong><br />\r\n<p>So, cast your vote because your one vote can change the entire scenario, in fact, at the last moment and could lead a nation towards the healthy and developed ones. Thus, on the polling date i.e. on Feb 8, voters can exercise their franchise from morning 8 am onwards. However, it is also suggested, and one should make a note of it that, you should not vote to the candidate getting influenced by your near and dear ones. This is so because, most of the times, people vote to those parties by getting influenced from their friends, family members, relatives or other acquaintances. On the other hand, the people who influence others are also requested not to brainwash or influence others in such a way that their vote seems useless or gets wasted. Doing so results in malpractices for both the people; the one who gets influenced and the one who influences others. </p><br />\r\n<p>Observing all such observations, the Election Commission of India has moved towards the EVMs (Electronic Voting Machine). EVMs have replaced the concept of Ballot Papers because people were encouraging others for forceful voting and were encouraging the candidates towards the victory. Thus, such practices are of no use, if each one would influence others for forceful voting. Basically, such kind of practice had also become a monotony as well wherein, family traditions could be listed on top. This is so because, most of the Family’s HOD say that, we have always been a supporter of this particular party from our generations so, we will be casting our vote to the same without knowing that what are their right and wrongdoings.<br />\r\nSo, open up your mind and be so rational to caste a right vote to the right candidate or a ruling party.  </p><br />\r\n ',	0,	0,	0,	6000,	1,	'2020-02-10 09:50:11',	'2020-02-10 09:50:11'),

This is because, the government had wanted a proper notice to be sent to 4 convicts wherein, a judicial bench headed by Justice R Bhanumathi hadn’t heeded this request and said that, the matter would delay further.</p><br />\r\n<p>Owing to this, the patience of the nations is being tested. Additionally, Vinay Sharma did file a mercy petition in front of President Ram Nath Kovind wherein, his appeal had turned down to another convict Akshay Singh filing a mercy plea.

Unfortunately, the situation went out of control and the matter reached to the Supreme Court with filed pleas wherein, it has been expected that after the occasion of national importance (elections), the pleas would be enlightened. </p>\r\n<strong>Why disturbance in Nation? </strong>\r\n<p>Well, alongside all such concerns, issues, violence and riots, one must also thoroughly know the root cause of all such disrupting happenings inside the nation. The CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) was passed by the Indian Parliament on 12th December 2019 that amends the Citizenship Act of 1995. Under the religious persecution’s assumptions, it granted a swifter way to Indian citizenship mainly to those people who belong to minorities like Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jains, Parsi, Christians and people mainly from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. This act also meant for those people who entered India before 31st December 2014. Whereas, neither the act mentioned Muslims, nor did they offer the associated benefits to Muslim immigrants. Additionally, the worst part of the protest is that it has been immensely affecting the country’s economic crisis witnessing an increasing household debt as well as decreasing growth rate in income and other earning sources. </p>\r\n<strong>What’s Indifferent? </strong>\r\n<p>The protest of Shaheen Bagh began with a minimum of 10-15 women since 14th December 2019. Afterwards, this 2-digit number got extended to the strength of thousands and lakhs. Many people joined the protests including the students and children which then became 24*7 protest. Also, amid the huge crowd, most of the women were Muslim as they found of wearing a burqa. The unacceptable truth is that females with the new born babies or the lactating ones are also a part of this unworthy constant protest. </p>\r\n<strong>Hunger Strike</strong>\r\n<p>Also, to lead this protest further in most exceptional ways, many of the people amid the crowd have started volunteering it in different ways like Hunger Strike and Children Protest. Owing to this, few of the protestors were on hunger strike for days and later on got hospitalised. What was the use of doing this? Instead, one’s own health got affected and nothing happened, nothing got changed. The reason for the hunger strike was the police brutality on the students, violence on females in Jamia washroom’s and library and all the associated issues with the case. With the hunger strike, people also demanded the rollback of NRC and CAA. Unfortunately, no government office or associated governmental bodies took this hunger strike into consideration and even didn’t visit the protestors of the same. </p>\r\n<strong>Misinformation Misleading Children…Child Protest</strong>\r\n<p>Also, since day 1 of the strike, many of the children started joining their parents to participate in the strike. In the morning they attend their school afterwards they become the strike’s participant. Now, it seems like Shaheen Bagh has become an artistic space for most of the children because they express their thoughts through poetry, storytelling, mimicry, puppetry and painting graffiti. In fact, many children participate in the sit-in protest holding candles in their hands. Participating children in the protest get dressed in tricolour and express the informed thoughts by their parents.</p>\r\n<p>Observing all such unethical practices, since 21st January 2020, the NCPCR (National Commission for Protection of Child Rights) has asked the concern authorities to guide the children providing the counselling towards the protests while making them understand what’s right and what’s wrong. This is so because such drastic concerns could also drive the children towards the mental trauma likewise the way they are undergoing with the provided misinformation. </p>\r\n<strong>The nation needs the right way to run where unity needs priorities over protests. </strong>\r\n ',	0,	0,	0,	7000,	2,	'2020-02-11 18:07:32',	'2020-03-02 14:47:01'),

Seriously, in the present scenario, social networking sites have replaced the physical presence of the people into a completely new virtual world. Therein, it could be also determined that many various sorts of technologies can equally inhibit or enhance various forms of the interactivity and it’s all credit goes to IT (Information Technology). This is so because, in today’s virtual world, IT is the only major component that applies to social media simultaneously affecting as well as effecting the life of people. </p><br />\r\n<p>As we are talking about the interaction that has been transformed into the virtual domain, there exist different kinds of interactivity that people often take into consideration. Enlightening such concerns, find below some interactivity types: </p><br />\r\n<strong> Inherent interactivity </strong><br />\r\n<p>As its name itself suggest Inherent Interactivity, it fundamentally focusses on machine-based learning. Today, there have been most of the media platforms available on the Internet that are inherently active wherein, it pushes the people to react in a way like a behaviourist computer-based learning encourages people to react. It is not surprising that technologies that control a learner’s responses are often associated with more behaviourist approaches to learning.</p><br />\r\n<strong>Designed Interactivity </strong><br />\r\n<p>Several times it happens that some media gets utterly designed that automatically generates interest in the learners inclusive of engaging interactions. The concept could be understood with an instance. Suppose a webpage isn’t inherently active that it was expected to be but, on the other hand, it could be designed interactively to make the learners the informed and rational decisions or choices.</p> <br />\r\n<strong> User-Generated Interaction </strong><br />\r\n<p>This form of interactivity is oriented with the Digital Age. Some media doesn’t always comprise of the in-built interaction wherein, its end users could still interact either with some physical responses or cognitively. For instance, the concept could be better understood considering an incident of an art gallery. Several times, people inside the art gallery respond either emotionally or cognitively to some of the particular paintings while simultaneously others may just have a glance of it or simply passes by. As per the student’s concerns, they may choose to make sketches or drawings from the painting, etc.<br/> <br />\r\nNevertheless, media that is responsible both in encouraging and provoking people have also cost some associated advantages with it. Therein, it has somewhere improved and deteriorate the interaction’s quality that becomes difficult to analyse or monitor.</p> <br />\r\n<p> Henceforth, it could be analysed that somewhere digitization plays a prominent role and somewhere is a slippery component majorly when it comes in categorizing the media sources on the grounds of learning & interaction. This is so because both the instructors, as well as the learners, often have the options and preferences of choosing and using the medium pertaining that how it affects the learner’s interaction and feedback happening inside the single medium. Therefore, the design’s quality of having interactive experiences is highly important over the medium of interaction that enables activity.<br/> <br />\r\nHowever, it should also be noted that the technology’s choice can often reduce the activity’s level including the interaction’s quality. Alongside this, when it comes to the real scenarios, people are more likely to make use of an amalgamation of media assuring a quality-oriented and interactivity associated activities. Simultaneously, on the other hand, making use of varied media sources or channel are often likely to increase both the workload and the cost as well amid the learners and instructors. </p><br />\r\n ',	0,	0,	0,	10000,	2,	'2020-02-14 15:00:52',	'2020-03-02 12:53:18'),

But, neither a father nor a mother lets their child to leave them in the era of their crucial age i.e. in the old age, to distribute the property while betraying them and there are a lot of reasons that people these days have a lot of burden in their hearts via which they too curse their children. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Why parents are overwhelmed & burdened?</strong><br />\r\n<p>No parent curses their children and even no child wants to be cursed but unfortunately, today’s younger generation doesn’t understand and value their parents.

Majorly, it’s a form of bullying an individual that could be affected with a deeper emotional trauma wherein, teenage and young generation becomes a huge trap. Moreover, the worst part is that strangers or people passing by do comment on body shaming seems very common but uncommon fact is that, these days, body shaming is done by our near and dear ones such as friends, society’s acquaintances, relatives, friends, etc.</p><br />\r\n<strong>Comments & Taunts: WHY & HOW</strong><br />\r\n<p>Comments like, why does she wear that, why does he so fat, why are they short and fat or tall and skinny in fact, there is ‘n’ number of comments associated with the concept of body shaming.

These days, most of the magazines, advertisements as well as the social media platforms are continuously contributing to body shaming in varied different forms leading a normalize behavior amid the critics and sufferers. Most of the daily soaps, documentaries, and movies are following the pattern to change society’s ideology towards body shaming. <br/><br />\r\nThey have fallen to follow the pattern in such a way that an obese or a fat character is subjected to comic relief and criticism and helps people changing their mindsets.

Natural appearance is not in one’s own hands if he or she is skinny or shorter, fatty or taller. Thus, it is mandatory for everyone to self-love.</p><br />\r\n<p> Also, the finest way to avoid such criticism is that, if anyone faces body shaming on social media then, he/she can instantly flag or report that particular content.

The big point here is - each and every citizen in India has the right to avail proper health care facilities. Today India reported its first casualty from Coronavirus. <strong>Yes, it is time the Government does as little as providing FREE MASKS for ALL!</strong> After all, it is to protect and prevent us from the life-threatening virus - Coronavirus. </p>\r\n<p>More the Coronovairus cases rise in India - the more are incidents of masks and sanitizers disappearing from the shelves in marketplaces, chemists and even online. Moreover, <strong>some chemists are even trying to sell these items at 2-3 times the price.</strong></p>\r\n<p>WHO (The World Health Organization) has already issued a warning regarding the shortage of equipment for personal protection due to the sudden rise in demand. It is mainly due to panic buying, misuse, and even hoarding. <strong>Therefore, the WHO has urged the Government and Industry both to raise the percentage of manufacturing by 40%</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Big players in the E-Commerce retailer businesses like Amazon, Big Basket, Grofers and Flipcart do not have ample stocks in some locations.  Thus, people are terrorized by the non-availability of stocks and the government not doing anything to help the situation.</p>\r\nIt is of little consolation to know huge retail chains like Big Bazaar, Spencer\'s, Reliance Smart and Reliance Fresh have assured the supply of sanitizer stocks. Even sales of handwash have risen in the past few weeks. Thus, Himalaya Drugs and Reckitt Benckiser have spiked up the production of hand sanitizers. But, the question is - is someone monitoring all of this. Is the Government just sitting on the situation and not doing anything until the avalanche hits them. Will it be too late by then?\r\n\r\n<h4><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><strong>We the people of India demand - Free Masks for All:</strong></span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;\"><strong>Our elected Government should take it upon them to manage the production, distribution, and logistics of masks across the country.

Do you know India contributes an additional 1,000,000 kids to its already high population every 20 days? With a growth rate of 20% per decade Indian population has deep and long-lasting repercussions. Indian has a population of 1.3 people currently, making it the second most populated country in the world. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><strong>Problems Due to Rising Population: </strong></span><br />\r\nThe food deficit, pollution and deteriorating sanitation and infrastructure to top the list. No matter how much the economic growth rate rises, the living standards do not raise at the same rate. In India, only <strong><em>\"only 6% of India\'s poor have access to tap water versus 33% of the non-poor.\"</em>  </strong>Sanitation till date remains a huge ongoing issue that the government is unable to address. Moreover, India has some of the most polluted cities in the world. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Two-Child Policy in India:</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore January 2020 India did not have a National Child policy. Thus family Planning Policies like Two-Child Policy comes as the need of the hour by the Indian Government. National Volunteer Organization (RSS) leader Mohan Bhagwat declared in January 2020 his organization\'s primary goal as a Two-Child Policy. The proposal is being criticized as an attempt to curtail the Indian Muslim Population. <br />\r\nIndia’s National Population Policy aims to stabilize India’s population by 2045. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong><em>\"A two-child policy is a government-imposed limit of two children allowe</em></strong><strong><em>d per </em></strong></span><strong><em><span style=\"font-size:16px;\">family, with the perks of government subsidies given only to the first two children.\"</span></em></strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnder the two-child policy - persons with more than two children would not be eligible to serve in government jobs. The act also called the Population Control Act, 2016 is applicable to all of India. As per the act, no person should procreate more than two living children after a period of one year from the commencement of the Act. <br />\r\nMany Indian states have adopted the two-child policy. It was Assam where the policy was most recently implemented in 2017. By 2017, 12 states had called for the two-child limitation for being eligible for a government job. The states are Odisha, Bihar, Chattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana. The policy has repealed by some of the states like Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Chattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. <br />\r\nAs per a report of the East Asia Forum India\'s population is projected to be 1.69 billion by 2050. It will make India\'s population higher than that of China.  Looking at the population prediction of India by 2050 the country may undergo a crisis situation. The demand for food and water will double up by 2050. India may be able to feed the growing population, however, may not be ecologically sustainable. Thus, the two-child policy is the most promising solution to the family planning initiative by the Indian Government. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n ',	0,	0,	0,	20000,	2,	'2020-03-13 16:35:25',	'2020-03-13 16:36:47'),

It is dangerous for a country as densely populated as India. Until now, cases of Coronavirus were due to people who travelled to Italy, France and other\r\ncountries and came in contact with others who were infected.\r\nAs per analysis based on research conducted in China and the US, it is estimated there were\r\n37,400 people in China who were infected by 18th February. Authorities did not even know\r\nabout them since they were asymptomatic. These people unknowingly exposed the other larger\r\npopulation to help to spread the virus.\r\n\r\nTwo days ago in India, a 20-year-old man travelled by train from Delhi to Chennai. The\r\nauthorities did not find his travel history of any contact with anyone who travelled abroad - but\r\nhe tested positive for Coronavirus. This case sends alarm bells ringing. It was India first case of\r\nCoronavirus due to community transmission.\r\n\r\nIn countries like Italy, Dubai, South Korea, the fatalities caused due to Covid-19 surged only\r\nafter the community transmissions began. It is impossible for their governments to stop the\r\nspread of the virus infection now.\r\nStepping out is as bad as a CRIME:  \r\nElderly people above 65 Years of age are at High Risk of catching the Coronavirus. Indian\r\ncurrently has above 80 million people of age 65 and above.\r\n  33% of the Indian population lives in home\'s less than the size of a prison cell. They are\r\nhighly susceptible to community transmission of Covid-19. \r\n\r\n24% of our Urban Population lives in Slums. People in these Communities do not earn\r\nenough to meet their daily expenses - leave alone get themselves tested for Coronavirus.\r\n<p>\r\nMoreover, “the ICMR also set a price cap of 4,500 rupees ($60) for the test\" How will the\r\npoor get themselves tested? Is the big question.\r\nCases in India may have been slow so far, however, by April 15 the country will be overflowing\r\nwith infected people. Dr T. Jacob John, former head of Indian Council for Medical Research\'s\r\nCentre for Advanced Research and Virology, warns that India\'s epidemic could grow worse\r\nthan the fatalities in Iran or Italy.</p><br/>\r\n\r\nBefore it is too late:\r\n\r\n<strong>\r\nWe are just two steps away from the Covid 19 pandemic which could hit 10% of India\'s\r\npopulation of 1.33 Billion people.

Every destination comprises of some unique energy profile wherein, some regions still require more and more greenery and energy sourcing. <br/><br />\r\n2.<b>Green energy venues:</b> Explore the destinations that are not much blessed with the low-emissions components. Here is the best step to make a move. Try to explore the venue where more and more sources of renewable energy could be adopted both by the place and the people. <br/><br />\r\n3.<b>Responsible transportation:</b> Both practically and ideally, green-minded environmental practices could easily avoid additional use of energy majorly when it comes to transportation and commuting by designing walkable, cycle-able and transit-accessible vehicles. On the other hand, if such components don’t seem possible to have or avail at the respective moment then, try to find out the hybrid or electric vehicles inclusive of biodiesel as well. <br/><br />\r\n4.<b>Portable generation:</b> To adopt portable generation mostly prove to reduce the energy load over your power generator. Such form of initiative pertaining to generators result in the least polluting and makes the least noise. <br/><br />\r\nHenceforth, the safety of the environment is in our hands only, the more we conserve it, the more we would be able to reserve the resources for the upcoming time. So, with our core focus on energy and environment saving, each one of us must play a native role to safe everything from its core.</p> <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n ',	0,	0,	0,	6000,	3,	'2020-03-02 17:37:44',	'2020-03-27 14:50:55'),

With the passing away of the gas, they again came back to the<br />\r\nChulhas using kerosene oil and other kinds of solid fuels. The emitted smoke from<br />\r\nsuch substances led to hazardous health issues. Moreover, as per the World Health<br />\r\nOrganisation, worldwide, 3.8 million people die because of the smoke exposure from<br />\r\nthe dirty stoves.

If,<br />\r\nUjjwala Scheme has been properly implemented focusing on the low cost of the gas<br />\r\nrefill then, it could have successfully helped the sufferers which they have been<br />\r\nfacing because of the constant use of Chulhas. <br />\r\nThe use of Chulhas adversely affects human health that it can cause a loss of vision,<br />\r\nlungs problem, inhaling or other breathing problems and a lot more than one can<br />\r\never imagine. For your safeguard, you need to take any action while not fully relying<br />\r\non government schemes. However, the government must support people with the<br />\r\nproper implementation of such schemes. It must organize the schemes that it may<br />\r\nnot affect the people for a shorter time span, in fact, help them in solving all their<br />\r\ndaily hurdles. <br />\r\nOne Initiative is Essential<br />\r\nThe people of such areas are out of the reach of a flourished money, so they feel<br />\r\nthemselves helpless.

Also, as per the government concerns, it<br />\r\nshould have set up the reasonable prices of gas refilling that people from Chulhas<br />\r\nmay move towards the LPG. This would surely bring a positive effect on society and<br />\r\nthe economy. <br />\r\nAgain, the concluded reason states that the unaffordability of LPG cylinders is the<br />\r\ncore concern of using Chulhas with the help of cow dung and coal that are easily<br />\r\naccessible. Else, in the fastest running era of the technology where Gas Stove is<br />\r\nbeing also replaced by the Electronic Induction, who wants to cook food on the<br />\r\nburning wood emitting fumes.

Moreover, the prices are expected to soar more by the end of February 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Triggering of Unseasonable Rainfall led Crop Damage  </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prices of onion have risen drastically in all over the country. The reason behind the rising cost is unseasonal rain as well as the shortage of onion crop. Also, the worst part is that the rising cost has not even benefited a single farmer instead they have complained that none of the onion crops has been fetched because of its poor quality. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Increasing Consumption led to Decreasing Requirements </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In accordance with some sophisticated sources, in India, the monthly consumption of onions was 15 lakh metric tons which shows a requirement of 50 thousand metric tons. But, with the high cost, the daily supply has become 10-12%, as of now. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Appeal to Government – a Solution for a Common Man</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people and other associated welfare bodies have asked the government to create onion’s buffer stock, distribution of the staple at a reasonable cost, a crackdown on the hoarding of onion’s traders, etc just to relief a middle class and a common man. Onion as a staple of each kitchen in every household has affected not only the general public but a huge mass of farmers as well. Indian farmers have emotionally expressed a painful concern because most of them are distributing the old stock of onion because of the damaging of new onions. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just because the wholesale market has seen a huge spike in the cost, it has simultaneously affected the resulting market as well. Wherein, this sharper jump is restricting the public to make a hole in their pockets. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nationwide surge in the spike of onion price has affected most of the Indian states and cities such as Pune, Maharashtra, Chennai, Mumbai, Odisha, West Bengal, Kolkata, Delhi and a lot more. Therein, it has affected the market chain by affecting both the sellers and consumers in buying an onion. Nevertheless, daily consumers are unfortunately are forced to reduce their purchases and are cooking their delicious food as – onion free. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Battlefield between State & Central Government </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, the worst condition expressed by the farmers is the rotten onion which can neither be used nor purchased and can only get wasted by throwing and dumping it in the dustbins. Most of the citizens have appealed to the Central Government to take impactful immediate actions but, the tussle amid the state and the central government is affecting the common man, alas!!! </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Onion’s Robbery at Dusk’s Early Hours </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the robbery of goods that can benefit you in any ground has been seen and observed in several different cases. But, have you ever heard of Onion’s robbery. Could you ever imagine that onions can also be getting stolen? Sounds funny; but, it’s true, 250kg onions worth ?2500 have been stolen from Gujarat vegetable shop during the early hours of dawn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Government in Jitters & Public in Tears </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such a looming onion crisis has put the government in jitters as well as the general public in tears. Therein, huge strata focussing on several households, cafes, and restaurants have been affected adversely. In short, this food inflation has made the entire nation cry where people are left with no choice just to maintain a cost-cutting for onion. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Indian Government must enlighten the issue and should immediately take the concern into consideration. This is because the continuous spike in the price is neither good for the country and nor for the Indian traders and farmers who are stagnantly witnessing a great fall in the onion demand.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Onion, with which every food tastes tasteless, is now getting reduced from the daily menus, dishes, and salads. However, to avoid the further disruption of the onion trade in the country, the government has placed orders for 6,090 tonnes of onions from Egypt to prevent India from Onion’s Crisis. This initiative would somewhere support the daily income of Indian farmers. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hope so, fresh and quality harvest may sooner hit the Indian market vanishing food inflation at its best.</p>\r\n',	0,	0,	0,	2000,	2,	'2019-12-06 05:32:46',	'2019-12-10 10:15:27'),

Also, the process of learning begins with birth. Well, coming to the major use of learning in the Employment sector, it gets stopped at a certain level or gets restricted because of cost-cutting.\r\nSince, the downfalls in the GDP and other aspects of the Indian Economy, most of the employees have suffered and are still suffering the firing policies. Herein, the targeted employees are either the over-qualified people as per the company’s standards or the employees that are high salaried.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMost of the organizations plan layoffs majorly for cost-cutting or due to the stagnant business strategies. Specifically talking about the private sector, employees always carry a mental trauma and fear or risk of losing their jobs because companies these days try to lay off approx. 5-8% of their entire workforce. </p>\r\n<strong>Why the Brain Drain? </strong>  \r\n<p> \r\nThis worst situation will also drown the country if the skill and talented mindsets would not be paid as per their qualifications, knowledge, and experience. This is also one of the major reasons for Brain Drain wherein, country and employment sectors should not have any authority to oppose and interfere. Just because, people both experienced and fresher do not get their demanded or wanted salary and become a victim of hire and fire hierarchy, seek for better opportunities in foreign countries. <p>   \r\n\r\n<p>    \r\nThey acquire and gain the knowledge fulfilling the criteria for any job role from India and work for other countries where their talent gets respect and they are paid as per their skills and knowledge.

On the other hand, coming to the government jobs, the competition is again too tough and stiff that a single vacancy for any of the designation requires the processing of 6-8 months. Most of the people from the age of 18 and above apply for the government vacancy with a hope that one day they may get a chance of having complete job security. Contradicting to this, again for a smaller number of vacancies, a huge number of people apply nationwide wherein, a few get a chance of selection.  <p>  \r\n    \r\n<strong>Employing the Unemployed has become an Occupation</strong>   \r\n<p>\r\nAlso, employing unemployed people has become a business. Most of the people play fraudulent activities with the name of branded organization and promise to unemployed ones providing a job with complete security. When a jobseeker gets influenced by the fraudsters, they ask for money. If a person gives the quoted amount then, these fraudsters run away leaving behind a no clue of their identification. </p>\r\n<p>    \r\nNo one knows where a nation will go if this would be continuing the way it is. Also, in the era of technology as well as digitalization, Information Technology (IT) domain is phasing the rough period of streamlining cost majorly concentrating on the employees of mid to senior level. Undoubtedly, this would further take the nation on the highest toll of unemployment in the next coming quarters.

The purpose of encountering the accused in this way was the part of the investigation. Also, the accused forcefully snatched the guns from the police and fired on them and tried to escape from the site immediately. For safeguard and justice purposes, the police fired and shot them in which all 4 accused died. Also, as per the investigation from Hyderabad Police, the accused intentionally punctured the tire of Priyanka’s two-wheeler, offered her help, took her to hidden spot and brutally raped her. All the 4 accused were lorry workers and aged amid 20-25 age group. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Court’s Justice or Police’s Action</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This time not waiting for the court’s justice, Hyderabad Police took initiate on their own and supported the nation in the justice of Priyanka’s family. Till date, there is no hidden fact, that the accused of Delhi Gang Rape 2012 are still in jail and no punishment has been announced for them. The duration of 7 years is not short.

A common man or a middle-class family affords a lawyer and a judge for the fair justice but, this has become a business to earn a livelihood now.

Was it Priyanka’s destiny or just was a furnished plan of the cops to give an answer to the nation for justice.? </p>\r\n<p>This time, immediate action has been taken while not hoping much from the judicial system. The nation is in the hope that no rape case may take place and no girl crossing on the road becomes a victim.

Still, it\'s not just gotten restricted to Haryana because India needs much more improvement in the context of Girl Child. </p><br />\r\n<p>According to some renowned sources, going back to 2011 (eight years ago), in the district like Jhajjar, no one could ever imagine giving birth to a girl. Also, as per the 2011 Census, Jhajjar considered the worst district in terms of Child Sex Ratio and was also listed on the top as the worst-performing district. After Jhajjar, the district like Rewari and Kurukshetra came next in such context.</p> <br />\r\n<p>The country’s only motto is to lead its citizens with the great zeal towards each era including the girl child. Thus, it is mandatory to improve and promote gender equality wherein, since 2015, PM Narendra Modi’s launched Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana from Sonipat has a bit effected the people. </p><br />\r\n<p>Since the conceptualization as well as the launch of this campaign, awareness regarding education and protecting the girl child has been increased. But, only the initiative from the government’s ends or no other government policies would work until the people would start taking initiative on their own. </p><br />\r\n<p>Since 2019, according to the sources, it has seen that a CSR of 1,647:1000 is found in Dighal village wherein, it is doing much better in raising voice against child sex abuse in compliance with its other neighbouring villages.</p> <br />\r\n<p>Also, as per the societal point of view, still today there exists a lot of people whose mindsets have changed towards gender biases and gender equality. Not everyone is feminist and not everyone abuses child sex. Today’s present generation doesn’t find and judge anything wrong or exceptional in having a baby girl. This is because, in almost all fields today, ranging from personal to professional ones, girls dominate everywhere. </p><br />\r\n<p>On the other hand, still, the majority of the older generation believe in stereotypes and strive their best in resisting the present generation to have a girl over a boy. Somewhere somehow still the fact exists in the society that having a first baby as a girl people prefer to have a boy as a second. Slowly or sooner things need to change and that definitely would bring the best outcomes in the upcoming years. </p><br />\r\n<p>However, the fundamental purpose to launch Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana was to watch over the places and people who had involved themselves in the practices of using prenatal scanning or female infanticide to know the baby’s sex before his birth or within the female’s womb.</p> <br />\r\n<p>In addition to this, as per the press release of 2018’s state government, it has observed that the sex ratio is the year 2016 was 871 girls for 1,000 boys which improved to 900 girls per 1,000 boys in the year 2017. The number has been improvised because of the actions taken by the people such as FIRs against child sex abuse, awareness programs and raids at suspected ultrasound centres. </p><br />\r\n<p>Alongside the initiative taken by the local citizens, the state health department also acted as the watchdogs over the centres conducting prenatal sex determination tests. For more of the awareness, one strongly needs to educate every girl in his family with a core objective focusing on gender determination which is illegal and on sexual biases as well. Gender equality must be all above in all the eras of one\'s life. This is because a boy or a girl is one\'s personal choice to make but not a societal decision to adopt. </p><br />\r\n ',	0,	0,	0,	1500,	2,	'2019-12-10 11:23:27',	'2019-12-12 09:57:58'),

But, this also needs to be understood by the society that marriage is not only about physical love, sex or romance. If in any married relationship, without considering the tenure of the wedding, if your spouse especially your wife is not ready or prepared for physical love and you are forcing her to have that attention then, unfortunately, you are raping her, martially. </p><br />\r\n<strong>What Marital Rape states?</strong> <br />\r\n<p>To force a woman for physical love and attention without her permission in a marital relationship is known as Marital Rape. </p><br />\r\n<p>Talking about the Marital Rape, Narendra Modi’s government destabilizes the institution of marriage which could also act as a weapon to harass husbands. The government needs to understand and discover a stronger correlation amid saving the marriage institution as well as criminalizing marital rape. It’s a matter of concern that how difficult it could be getting a raped by a husband. From a societal point of view, this is not a big deal and is an obvious point but, for a female, this is nothing less than a brutal rape when she is not prepared and is not willing for physical love. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Just because you’re married so, forceful sex is okay</strong><br />\r\n<p>In India, there seem a lot of females who are a victim of the marital rape and continuously appeal for the justice but there is no hearing in the eyes of law, in the grounds of court and, in fact, in front of families. This is so because everyone seems that a couple is married so sex is official and is okay but, the concern gets over neglected that whether a person is willing or not without noticing that it’s a married couple. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Woman – a subject for sex, machine producing babies and idol of romance</strong><br />\r\n<p>Additionally, as per the societal point of view, in marital sex, a reasonable person is always a male wherein, a woman always ends up as a device of baby-making as well as an idol of romance. A typical marital rapist is the one who still believes that a woman can be ruled and dominated as per his will and choice. Also, he feels that in sexual matters if he wants sex then, she should be glad and if she isn’t then, a man has a complete right to force her. Overall this shows that he is an object and a lady is a sexual subject to play or mold with. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Feminism majorly exists in male dominating society</strong> <br />\r\n<p>Still today, the society is somewhere male-dominant where being feminist is not wrong. Thus, in such a male dominant society woman’s struggle is not only limited but reasonable as well. All man seriously needs to understand that a woman is not a sexual property.

Police agencies such as Hyderabad Police, Delhi Police, and Surat Police are some departments that comprise of the facial recognition units.

Perhaps, facial recognition can indeed be helpful to an extent wherein, the police don’t have a right to use facial recognition without an ordered of the surveillance law by the Supreme Court.</p><br />\r\n<strong>Anti-Social is a Taboo</strong><br />\r\n<p> The in the process of being anti-social getting a taboo in the society, the state as well as its associated agents do not have any authority to branding someone when the protestor’s identity is unknown. Worldwide, there exist a lot of people who are completely in the process of facial recognition. But, on the contrary, in a country like India, neither the process of face recognition has been banned nor it is becoming a source of a meaningful piece of information for the country’s citizens. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Saying is Easy than Proving</strong><br />\r\n<p>Last but not the least; anyone can easily say that the Indian Police Department might be doing this everywhere but the fact is that most of the experiments have been carried out all across the nation regarding this process affecting everyone somewhere somehow.

In such a case, it’s better to discover the team based incentives because this could be effective enough to make employees passionate and enthusiast towards the work simultaneously would lead in increasing both the performance and productivity. However, if an organization doesn’t work on team-based rewards then, it must include it in its rewards program where devoted resources to team-based rewards must be substantial. Such a practice would surely go to leave a significant impact on employee’s cohesiveness as well as cooperation.<br/> <br />\r\nOn the contrary, there could also be a fatal flaw of not rewarding the top performers thusly, a good performer should never be taken for granted in order to maintain and flourish the top talent not only in the team but also in the organization. So, timely acknowledgment of rewards on excellent performance is a must. </p><br />\r\n<p>However, there is also some certain factor associated with maintenance of top talents which becomes obvious and natural after some point in time.

This could believe that long-term reward programs leave a positive effect on the overall performance leading to generate the long-lasting results.

Having said that, the declaration of such law is unconstitutional as well as discriminatory against women. As per the judgement, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court without opposition rule stated that having a sexual relationship with a female without her husband’s knowledge was a criminal offence. On the contrary, as stated above, it has been unconstitutional and has not been accepted by the people to an extent. </p><br />\r\n<p><b>Section 497 of the Indian penal code states that adultery law must be gender-neutral as it could become an obstacle against a spouse abandoning their respective families.</b> This concern majorly applies to the rural areas where most of the families still live in the oldest tradition and have stereotype mindsets. Also, it majorly and obviously affects the strata of woman that wield a little power especially when it comes to the patriarchal areas of some districts in the country.<br/><br />\r\nWith an alarming concern of the rising adultery in the nation, most of the women also approach to the respective commissions or other governmental bodies stating that their husband act in an adulterous manner, behave weirdly and have left them to take care and look after their children. Therefore, a heavy amount of the woman can get justice with the law wherein, their husband feels themselves in a kind of fear whilst entering into a new relationship.

However, it would be applied only if both the victims as well as the perpetrator are married.

Additionally, while such kind of judgement is found to have a fearing impact amid the people, could impact a large number of marriages in India. Therein, the fallouts also couldn’t be overlooked or ignored. <br/><br />\r\nIn India, with the rising rates of the divorce, marital infidelity and varied forms of the associated cases with it can seriously endanger the institution of marriage.

But, <b>after the commitments and judgements provided by the Supreme Court</b>, such law won’t prevail. </p><br />\r\n<p>Alongside this, as per the section 497 of Indian Penal Code, Supreme Court has struck section 198 of Code of Criminal Procedure allowing the spouse to bring the charges against a man committing adultery with his respective wife. <br/><br />\r\nUndoubtedly, with such serious concerns, the marriages could surely have a break down wherein; the future of the children could be in a lurch.

In other words, a baby is born with proper planning or just gets an accidental birth. This article would tell the real meaning, importance, benefits, advantages and almost everything associated with family planning.</p><br />\r\n<p>Before going in detail, just enlighten the history and some facts and findings of family planning as stated and quoted by the International Conference on Human Rights since 1968.</p><br />\r\n<p> In accordance with the conference, family planning is globally affirmed human right which is not limited to a married couple but applies to the entire members of a family, irrespective of the gender. As per the document released by the conference which is also called Teheran Proclamation, it clearly states that <b>“Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children.”</b></p><br />\r\n<p>On the other hand, it is also important to note that, India being the vast population country, one can’t overlook the implications of population explosion. Therein, over the last couple of years, the population growth is found on the urge to exceed more and more, by and far. Additionally, it is also notable that this urge of the population has reached to the surge due to the contributions of socio-economic culture and conditions, historical facts, policy changes and a lot more. </p><br />\r\n<p>Thus, people of the country are requested to deliver a limited as well as a planned baby which would help in the contribution of the quality population whilst population growth and control. </p><br />\r\n<p> Therefore, for a purpose of upholding a right quality family planning, people should concentrate on the below-mentioned parameters that are required to be implemented, monitored and regulated for the healthy changes in the concerning family planning.</p><br />\r\n<strong>No Gender Biasness</strong><br />\r\n<p> Family Planning including all the concerns associated with it must not be restricted to any sex, caste, creed, race, gender, religions, political views, language, nationality, economic status, native place, marital status, disability status etc. Doing so could result in ‘n’ numbers of mental trauma inside the person expecting to have a newborn. </p><br />\r\n<strong> Awareness</strong><br />\r\n<p> Coming to the precautions and contraceptive pills, proper information, awareness and knowledge must be circulated to everyone without hesitations. Sex education is necessary especially when it comes to serious concerns like Family Planning. Thus, sex education should be available to everyone at the right age and time based on the fractioning needs, differentiating factors and some little barriers associated with the same. Hence, it becomes exceptionally essential to understand the information’s quality depending on the background, education and health infrastructure. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Hassle-Free Implementation of Ideologies for Family Planning </strong><br />\r\n<p>When it comes to the implementation and formulation of the entire guidelines in the context of the <b>family planning</b>, there must not be a lack of access towards the hassle-free implementation. Here, access means the level and depth of rigor pertaining to accessibility and affordability. Herein, both the physical accessibility as well as affordability is the two major components that must be taken into consideration while thinking of expanding your generation or family. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Healthy Acceptance of Contraceptives </strong><br />\r\n<p>While intimacy and <strong>another discussion of family planning</strong>, it is highly suggestible to properly make use of contraceptive products that too in a dignified way while respecting the modern ways of medical policies and ethics as well. </p><br />\r\n<strong>No hide and seek in communication</strong><br />\r\n<p> While having a discussion about other members of the family pertaining to the concerns and issues of family planning, proper communication with respect to everyone’s acceptance and ideologies must be respected. This is so because; a small idea or view of any family member could guide a spouse towards the right ways. Thus, clear communication is necessary without pressurizing and provoking anyone. Moreover, coming to the contraceptive commodities, it must be purchased and rendered by sophisticated sanitary personnel. </p><br />\r\n<strong> Informed & Mutual Decisions </strong><br />\r\n<p> A family doesn’t restrict to the spouse and parents instead while panning a baby, most of the relations start getting connected with each other and with a baby as well before his or her birth in the world. So, while thinking of the <b>family planning</b>, each member of the family must be informed well enough reflecting free misrepresentation of the views and personal relationship. Herein, contraceptive counseling essentially becomes comprehensive equipping members to apprehend their decisions.</p><br />\r\n<strong> Not Disclosing the Maternity Matters </strong><br />\r\n<p>Best and healthy treatment is the most crucial factor to attain during family planning and other further processes of the same. Therefore, maintaining complete confidentiality, privacy and security in the treatment and other decisions must be locked amid the doctors, health workers, co-staff and other members as well. This is so because, there are a lot of people who visit the maternity centers every day, disclosing the patient’s history would affect all in making effective decisions for planning a baby. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Women Involvement with no Forceful Decisions </strong><br />\r\n<p>While planning a family to conceive and deliver a baby, at last, it’s the woman only who has to deliver a baby. Thus, this must be ensured that the woman who becomes the recipient for family planning should be well prepared when it comes to the development spheres influencing her decision and other health measures. Additionally, when it comes to the policies concerning reproductive and sexual health, family planning must be called from an educational and healthy point of views involving gynecologists, doctors, and other co-working staff members.<br/><br />\r\nImperative accountability must be reflected in the massive family members majorly by doctors, sex educators, and lifestyle specialists, health personnel majorly including family doctors, physicians and gynecologists etc. in order to maintain a high standard of accountability. Owing to this, whatever efforts they would be putting would definitely bring the fruitful results in marginalizing people while making them self aware and informed simultaneously empowering them to make informed and positive decisions. <br/><br />\r\nFollowing all such essential parameters would help in implementing a healthy and quality <b>family planning irrespective </b>of any differences.

The worst part of their trick is that sometimes they show the artificial or toy gun which seems like an original sample just to threat the people hovering around.

Most often these robbers either carry a pair of extra jacket or shirt with them and always apply some lubricated substances on their body so that, if they get cached by someone they could easily slip and can run away. After acquiring the stolen goods, these robbers sell the desired products and earn their desirable profits. </p><br />\r\n<p>Their smooth escaping practice makes them difficult to trace whereas, surveillance of CCTV sometimes could help to an extent.

The major issue is the recognition of the same i.e. how to analyse and diagnose that whether a person is suffering from some illness is either Coronavirus or something else. So, the symptoms and diagnosis of the virus are mentioned below: <br/>\r\n· Fever <br/>\r\n· Cough <br/><br />\r\n· Shortness of breath  <br/>\r\n· Runny Nose <br/>\r\n· Headache  <br/>\r\n· Sore Throat <br/>\r\nThough such symptoms are found to be very common and can be easily cured but in case of such virus, these symptoms should not be overlooked as it has caused a large number of deaths these days in just the couple of days. Thus, for confirmed, 2019-nCoV infections have reported a severe illness leading death. </p>\r\n<p>It is also believed that the symptoms of 2019-nCoV may appear either in 2 days or as long as in 14 days. Also, it is entirely based on the incubation period of the MERS virus. Apart from such noticeable symptoms, it also includes some other symptoms as well such as 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. All such symptoms generally caused some upper-respiratory tract illnesses majorly in the context of common cold, pneumonia or bronchitis. However, such illness is basically found in the people suffering from cardiopulmonary disease and the people with the weaker immune system. </p>\r\n<p> In addition to this, one should also enlighten that the other two associated symptoms of Coronavirus i.e. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have also become frequently familiar with the people resulting in life-ending happenings. With the sufferings of such virus, approx. 3-4 people out of 10 have been sentenced to death on almost frequent hourly intervals. </p>\r\n<strong>What precautions one should take for avoidance and prevention of Coronavirus? </strong>\r\n•    Frequent hand washing with alcohol-based hand wash or liquid soap as it would help in killing the germs and virus. <br/>\r\n•    Maintain respiratory hygiene. This would be only performed while covering both face and mouth with tissue paper or handkerchief mainly while coughing and sneezing. Doing so would help in preventing the germs and virus and could contaminate the objects or people you come into contact with. <br/>\r\n•    Stop touching your mouth, face, nose and eyes because touching such surfaces could result in virus contamination. Touching such parts may result in virus transferring immensely and exceptionally. <br/>\r\n•    Avoid consuming animal’s products (all forms of non-veg) and stop being into contact with the animals like camel, rats, cats, rodents, birds, bats and dogs as well. <br/>\r\n<p>Therefore, the diagnosis of such symptoms has been essentially required to save people from the massively growing epidemic all around the clock. Your doctors and other health care providers should examine you by performing some of the laboratory tests on respiratory specimens all the major blood test (called serum) in order to detect the presence of Coronavirus if any. If you found the test with positive results, then, you must immediately contact your doctor informing him about your recent travelling, non-veg intake and animal’s contact. A large number of MERS-CoV infections has been detected from Arabian Peninsula’s country and so, it becomes highly essential to note and report about your travel diaries and history or animal’s contact. Herein, animal contact fundamentally means with contact with camel or camel diaries and products.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, if you are suffering from fever, cough and cold then, you should immediately pay <br />\r\nattention to the same before it becomes serious or life-taking. </p>',	0,	0,	0,	10000,	2,	'2020-02-05 11:30:56',	'2020-03-02 12:32:03'),

Whereas, commonly, it’s a well-known and genuine process of choosing a representative of their choice via Elections. </p><br />\r\n<p>A country which is democratic and values the people’s identity and dignity irrespective of any religion, caste or creed; faces and respects the process of Elections. Ranging from the election of Lok Sabha (General Election), State Assembly (Vidhan Sabha Election), By-election, Rajya Sabha (Upper House Election) each citizen of the nation has a complete right to vote. <br />\r\nAs mentioned above <strong>“One Vote, One Value”</strong> has a major meaning in itself that couldn’t be taken for granted. This majorly means that each candidate can vote once during the time of Elections to their preferred party. This is so because each casted vote gets counted to announce the results. It’s our casted vote that we perform to choose the party to be ruled after the results get announced on the specified date.</p> <br />\r\n<p>Sooner, the National Capital Region i.e. New Delhi is going to have Elections to choose the Chief Minister of the Nation. As of now, the present C.M. of Delhi is Mr Arvind Kejriwal who belongs to Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) having a symbol of Broom. Fingers Crossed, it all depends on the number of votes that whether again AAP is going to rule, or some other party would overtake AAP.</p> <br />\r\n<strong>Polling Dates</strong><br />\r\n<p>Since the date of Election in Delhi has been announced as 8th February 2020 (Saturday), the Election Commission of India announced its complete schedule prior a month back in order to elect the legislative assembly of Delhi. Alongside this, the result will be announced on 11th February 2020 (Tuesday). </p><br />\r\n<p>In addition to this, as per the Election Commission of India, the vote’s counting would begin from early morning 8 am onwards until 6 pm on Saturday: 11th Feb.

All the political parties are cheering up and boosting themselves to be healthy as well as a successful part of the election. However, as per the political scenarios, there have been 3 concerned contests amid Congress, Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). People just could only assume or predict based on their interest and votes that which party would going to rule. However, the final result will be declared on Feb 11. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Vote has a deeper meaning and value </strong><br />\r\n<p>So, cast your vote because your one vote can change the entire scenario, in fact, at the last moment and could lead a nation towards the healthy and developed ones. Thus, on the polling date i.e. on Feb 8, voters can exercise their franchise from morning 8 am onwards. However, it is also suggested, and one should make a note of it that, you should not vote to the candidate getting influenced by your near and dear ones. This is so because, most of the times, people vote to those parties by getting influenced from their friends, family members, relatives or other acquaintances. On the other hand, the people who influence others are also requested not to brainwash or influence others in such a way that their vote seems useless or gets wasted. Doing so results in malpractices for both the people; the one who gets influenced and the one who influences others. </p><br />\r\n<p>Observing all such observations, the Election Commission of India has moved towards the EVMs (Electronic Voting Machine). EVMs have replaced the concept of Ballot Papers because people were encouraging others for forceful voting and were encouraging the candidates towards the victory. Thus, such practices are of no use, if each one would influence others for forceful voting. Basically, such kind of practice had also become a monotony as well wherein, family traditions could be listed on top. This is so because, most of the Family’s HOD say that, we have always been a supporter of this particular party from our generations so, we will be casting our vote to the same without knowing that what are their right and wrongdoings.<br />\r\nSo, open up your mind and be so rational to caste a right vote to the right candidate or a ruling party.  </p><br />\r\n ',	0,	0,	0,	6000,	1,	'2020-02-10 09:50:11',	'2020-02-10 09:50:11'),

The raped girl named “Nirbhaya” died because of her brutal and severe injuries in a Singapore hospital but unfortunately, her culprits are still alive till date. Wherein, it was expected that her culprits were expected to be hanged on January 22, 2020, in Delhi’s Tihar Jail, it got postponed for February 1st in the early morning at 6 am and now is continuously getting delay and dates over dates.</p><br />\r\n<p>This unethical behavior of delaying justice is disturbing the nation and most specifically the accused mother. Nirbhaya’s mom is eagerly waiting for the culprit’s punishment. Every time she stands with a hope of some good news for the culprits to be hung but unfortunately and alas!!! Instead of getting punishment, the tenure of their life is getting extended while delaying justice.</p><br />\r\n<p>Nirbhaya means fearless. Jyoti Singh who was 23 years old physiotherapist was gang-raped in a running bus at Munirka in South Delhi. She was so brutally raped, assaulted and thrown out of the bus with her friend (Avanindra Pandey). Because of this incident, Jyoti is named as Nirbhaya. Her friend was also assaulted. Both of them were thrown out of the moving bus wherein, the girl was thrown nude. Her boyfriend tried his best to save her life but unfortunately because of the severe internal injuries she was half dead and declared died in Singapore hospital. Doctor’s strived and tried their best to save her but just because of the lust of the 6 culprits, the girl exists no more. </p><br />\r\n<p>Out of the 6 people, 4 were the culprits wherein, Ram Singh and a juvenile were named as accused. However, the trial of the 5 adult men initiated in the special fast-track court since March 2013 but as of now, nation can see that since the beginning till date nothing has been changed instead, the culprits need of eating, sleep and repeat is getting extended. </p><br />\r\n<p>Ram Singh was the primary accused who allegedly committed a suicidal attempt in Tihar Jail by hanging himself after the beginning f the trial by the special fast track court.

Since the date of the incident, it has been almost 7-8 years, the juvenile would not remain juvenile. Additionally, the accused mainly named Mukesh Sharma, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur, Pawan Gupta have been also grown and definitely could not be of the same age that they were during committing a crime. </p><br />\r\n<p>So, with such delays definitely, the aggression would rise in the nation’s peeps and especially in all the near and dear ones, those who are associated with Jyoti Singh.

Most interestingly, the government had also challenged the verdict of Delhi High Court dismissing its plea against the execution of 4 men stay. This is because, the government had wanted a proper notice to be sent to 4 convicts wherein, a judicial bench headed by Justice R Bhanumathi hadn’t heeded this request and said that, the matter would delay further.</p><br />\r\n<p>Owing to this, the patience of the nations is being tested. Additionally, Vinay Sharma did file a mercy petition in front of President Ram Nath Kovind wherein, his appeal had turned down to another convict Akshay Singh filing a mercy plea. Filing mercy petitions have shown that the convicts are trying their level best to be released without being punished and are making each possible effort and loopholes to delay the execution.</p><br />\r\n<p>With seeing all such potential efforts of convicts, the Delhi High Court has given them a week time to finish exploring the legal help and thereafter the trial court will again start the proceedings for the execution of the case to come to an end. </p><br />\r\n<br />\r\n ',	0,	0,	0,	8000,	1,	'2020-02-10 11:35:28',	'2020-02-10 11:35:28'),

This 24*7 ongoing protest has also termed as sit-in peaceful protest which formerly led by women with the passage of CAA since 11 December 2019. The initial purpose of the protest was to assure the cops intervention against Jamia’s students who were strongly opposing the amendment of citizenship act.</p>\r\n<strong>What’s the use of doing the protest and creating violence? </strong>\r\n<p>It’s resulting in nothing except the threat to women’s safety, commodities rising cost, unemployment, poverty and a lot of more societal threats. With a major count of Muslim women, the constant protestors have also blocked various roads in Delhi NCR since December 15, 2019, using non-violent resistance for more than 55 days. Unfortunately, no one could say that how long these days are going to stretch. As of now, this protest has proven to be one of the longest on-going protests towards CAA, NRC & NPRA in India.</p>\r\n<strong>Reforming Phrase… </strong>\r\n<p>More or less, the protest is taking a new shape by and by as well as day by day. Since with its beginning with the citizenship amendment act, it has now started protesting against the BJP’s Government. Owing to this, the protestors are opposing the government\'s <strong>\"anti-labour policies\"</strong> and <strong>“2020 JNU Attack”</strong> as well.</p>\r\n<strong>Petition over Petition… Highway’s Blockade </strong>\r\n<p>The issues of highway blocking also called (blockade) had also become a campaign for 2020 Delhi’s Legislative Assembly Election with a promise made by campaigners that if the party gets voted into power the blockade would be removed for the election’s day. Moreover, the blockade affected huge traffic in a day abreast with delays of hours in the shortest journeys. </p>\r\n<p>Owing to this, around 5 petitions have been filed, as of now raising the issue of highways and roads blockade wherein, the Delhi High Court refused the hearings of initial 2 pleas and quoted towards the police matter. Simultaneously, on the other hand, the Delhi Police stated that they would use persuasion over force to take blockade at an end. When, this also failed to bring the result, again a third petition was filed on 18th January 2020 raising the student’s difficulty specifically during the exam’s time. Therein, the High Court again appeal the police to investigate the matter. Unfortunately, the situation went out of control and the matter reached to the Supreme Court with filed pleas wherein, it has been expected that after the occasion of national importance (elections), the pleas would be enlightened. </p>\r\n<strong>Why disturbance in Nation? </strong>\r\n<p>Well, alongside all such concerns, issues, violence and riots, one must also thoroughly know the root cause of all such disrupting happenings inside the nation. The CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) was passed by the Indian Parliament on 12th December 2019 that amends the Citizenship Act of 1995. Under the religious persecution’s assumptions, it granted a swifter way to Indian citizenship mainly to those people who belong to minorities like Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jains, Parsi, Christians and people mainly from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. This act also meant for those people who entered India before 31st December 2014. Whereas, neither the act mentioned Muslims, nor did they offer the associated benefits to Muslim immigrants. Additionally, the worst part of the protest is that it has been immensely affecting the country’s economic crisis witnessing an increasing household debt as well as decreasing growth rate in income and other earning sources. </p>\r\n<strong>What’s Indifferent? </strong>\r\n<p>The protest of Shaheen Bagh began with a minimum of 10-15 women since 14th December 2019. Afterwards, this 2-digit number got extended to the strength of thousands and lakhs. Many people joined the protests including the students and children which then became 24*7 protest. Also, amid the huge crowd, most of the women were Muslim as they found of wearing a burqa. The unacceptable truth is that females with the new born babies or the lactating ones are also a part of this unworthy constant protest. </p>\r\n<strong>Hunger Strike</strong>\r\n<p>Also, to lead this protest further in most exceptional ways, many of the people amid the crowd have started volunteering it in different ways like Hunger Strike and Children Protest. Owing to this, few of the protestors were on hunger strike for days and later on got hospitalised. What was the use of doing this? Instead, one’s own health got affected and nothing happened, nothing got changed. The reason for the hunger strike was the police brutality on the students, violence on females in Jamia washroom’s and library and all the associated issues with the case. With the hunger strike, people also demanded the rollback of NRC and CAA. Unfortunately, no government office or associated governmental bodies took this hunger strike into consideration and even didn’t visit the protestors of the same. </p>\r\n<strong>Misinformation Misleading Children…Child Protest</strong>\r\n<p>Also, since day 1 of the strike, many of the children started joining their parents to participate in the strike. In the morning they attend their school afterwards they become the strike’s participant. Now, it seems like Shaheen Bagh has become an artistic space for most of the children because they express their thoughts through poetry, storytelling, mimicry, puppetry and painting graffiti. In fact, many children participate in the sit-in protest holding candles in their hands. Participating children in the protest get dressed in tricolour and express the informed thoughts by their parents.</p>\r\n<p>Observing all such unethical practices, since 21st January 2020, the NCPCR (National Commission for Protection of Child Rights) has asked the concern authorities to guide the children providing the counselling towards the protests while making them understand what’s right and what’s wrong. This is so because such drastic concerns could also drive the children towards the mental trauma likewise the way they are undergoing with the provided misinformation. </p>\r\n<strong>The nation needs the right way to run where unity needs priorities over protests. </strong>\r\n ',	0,	0,	0,	7000,	2,	'2020-02-11 18:07:32',	'2020-03-02 14:47:01'),

Therein, it could be also determined that many various sorts of technologies can equally inhibit or enhance various forms of the interactivity and it’s all credit goes to IT (Information Technology).

Enlightening such concerns, find below some interactivity types: </p><br />\r\n<strong> Inherent interactivity </strong><br />\r\n<p>As its name itself suggest Inherent Interactivity, it fundamentally focusses on machine-based learning. Today, there have been most of the media platforms available on the Internet that are inherently active wherein, it pushes the people to react in a way like a behaviourist computer-based learning encourages people to react. It is not surprising that technologies that control a learner’s responses are often associated with more behaviourist approaches to learning.</p><br />\r\n<strong>Designed Interactivity </strong><br />\r\n<p>Several times it happens that some media gets utterly designed that automatically generates interest in the learners inclusive of engaging interactions. The concept could be understood with an instance. Suppose a webpage isn’t inherently active that it was expected to be but, on the other hand, it could be designed interactively to make the learners the informed and rational decisions or choices.</p> <br />\r\n<strong> User-Generated Interaction </strong><br />\r\n<p>This form of interactivity is oriented with the Digital Age. Some media doesn’t always comprise of the in-built interaction wherein, its end users could still interact either with some physical responses or cognitively. For instance, the concept could be better understood considering an incident of an art gallery. Several times, people inside the art gallery respond either emotionally or cognitively to some of the particular paintings while simultaneously others may just have a glance of it or simply passes by. As per the student’s concerns, they may choose to make sketches or drawings from the painting, etc.<br/> <br />\r\nNevertheless, media that is responsible both in encouraging and provoking people have also cost some associated advantages with it. Therein, it has somewhere improved and deteriorate the interaction’s quality that becomes difficult to analyse or monitor.</p> <br />\r\n<p> Henceforth, it could be analysed that somewhere digitization plays a prominent role and somewhere is a slippery component majorly when it comes in categorizing the media sources on the grounds of learning & interaction. This is so because both the instructors, as well as the learners, often have the options and preferences of choosing and using the medium pertaining that how it affects the learner’s interaction and feedback happening inside the single medium. Therefore, the design’s quality of having interactive experiences is highly important over the medium of interaction that enables activity.<br/> <br />\r\nHowever, it should also be noted that the technology’s choice can often reduce the activity’s level including the interaction’s quality. Alongside this, when it comes to the real scenarios, people are more likely to make use of an amalgamation of media assuring a quality-oriented and interactivity associated activities. Simultaneously, on the other hand, making use of varied media sources or channel are often likely to increase both the workload and the cost as well amid the learners and instructors. </p><br />\r\n ',	0,	0,	0,	10000,	2,	'2020-02-14 15:00:52',	'2020-03-02 12:53:18'),

Hence, every parent wants their children to be a good human being who must not throw away his parents but shares family meals on a table as it delights them.<br/> <br />\r\nAlso, parents feel the tremendous amount of trust in their children that their children would always support them and withstands by them in the ups and downs in their life especially their old age.

However, beholding this passion, we forget that this craze often results in severe mental disorders which later turn into mental health consequences majorly when it comes to an individual physical appearance.</p><br />\r\n<p>These days, portraying people who are either overweight or shorter in height has become very common by media and other associated sources. Such characters are highlighted like the running joke of the show that results in <strong>“lame fat jokes”</strong> as well as a crucial manifestation of self-doubt also termed as Body Shaming. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Body Shaming: A Drastic Bullying </strong><br />\r\n<p>A practice or an action of expressing humiliation about other people’s body gesture, size and shape are called body shaming. Majorly, it’s a form of bullying an individual that could be affected with a deeper emotional trauma wherein, teenage and young generation becomes a huge trap. Moreover, the worst part is that strangers or people passing by do comment on body shaming seems very common but uncommon fact is that, these days, body shaming is done by our near and dear ones such as friends, society’s acquaintances, relatives, friends, etc.</p><br />\r\n<strong>Comments & Taunts: WHY & HOW</strong><br />\r\n<p>Comments like, why does she wear that, why does he so fat, why are they short and fat or tall and skinny in fact, there is ‘n’ number of comments associated with the concept of body shaming. People commenting all such stuff even cannot imagine that to what extent do these comments and taunts can affect and hurt someone. Moreover, these humiliating concerns can downgrade the person that he/she starts doubting and questioning himself/herself like “I am so ugly”, “I am not handsome”, “Why I am so obese” and a lot more. </p><br />\r\n<p>Such kind of thoughts becomes so common and natural when a person becomes a victim of body shaming. Therefore, negative comments on someone’s body shape and size can extremely damage someone’s potential that leads a person towards low-self esteem, under-confident, anger, suicidal attempts, self-harm, and even body dysmorphic disorder.</p><br />\r\n<p>With such an alarming concern wherein, obesity has become a major social stigma has evolved a drastic as well as a serious issue for criticizing aspects of anyone’s body just because they are not being ideal. Unfortunately, with all such aspects, Indian societies have become extremely judgmental to judge everyone for a person’s appearance. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Manifestation’s Leading Results</strong><br />\r\n<p>The manifestation of body shaming can occur in different ways such as people shaming on you and oneself body shaming. This leaves a broader impact on people’s lives whilst feeling for their character. Such kind of a situation majorly results in criticism of one’s own appearance including other’s appearance in front of others via judgment or comparison with others. Alongside this, it also focuses on criticizing others without having knowledge of what to speak and what not. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Society need a change </strong><br />\r\n<p>Picking up of totally irrelevant flaws leads to shame and often perpetuates the ideology that people get judged only by their physical presence and features. These days, most of the magazines, advertisements as well as the social media platforms are continuously contributing to body shaming in varied different forms leading a normalize behavior amid the critics and sufferers. Most of the daily soaps, documentaries, and movies are following the pattern to change society’s ideology towards body shaming. <br/><br />\r\nThey have fallen to follow the pattern in such a way that an obese or a fat character is subjected to comic relief and criticism and helps people changing their mindsets. This is so because this kind of trending behavior majorly when it is focused on celebrity makes people help in understanding the arising potential consequences. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Can Body Shaming become a taboo?</strong><br />\r\n<p> Unlike any other kind of bullying, body shaming couldn’t become a taboo. It’s a victim only who has to stay positive and healthy in all the aspects accepting himself as it is. Also, society must also understand that commenting someone doesn’t make them feel appreciated instead generates a feeling of manifestation among the people that yes; seriously they have become a taboo for the society where they live. Natural appearance is not in one’s own hands if he or she is skinny or shorter, fatty or taller. Thus, it is mandatory for everyone to self-love.</p><br />\r\n<p> Also, the finest way to avoid such criticism is that, if anyone faces body shaming on social media then, he/she can instantly flag or report that particular content. National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA) has successfully stepped up in fighting and prohibiting against body shaming and encourages people who witness such concerns.</p><br />\r\n ',	0,	0,	0,	10000,	2,	'2020-02-24 12:46:35',	'2020-03-02 12:53:01'),

Women who are entirely perceived as seeking superiority over men rather than equality or to describe all feminists. In the present scenario, the feminism advocates gender equality but it is largely misconstrued as an anti-male concept. <br/><br />\r\nFeminism has become a need of an hour as gender biasedness which is obviously an extremely sad reality today. Whereas, Feminism to us is equality. At the global times, there is not even a single man over woman and vice versa. The concept of feminism is a very misconstrued and misunderstood topic. This is because when we say feminism, it does not mean that all men should become subordinate and women should be the ones who rule the world. </p><br />\r\n<strong>A Real Feminism or Feminist Associated Meaning </strong><br />\r\n<p>The only way we or the today’s youth can have a progressive, as well as successful world, is when both men and women treat each other as equals without dominating each other and without any discrimination as well. However, everyone is aware that both men and women have different roles to play in every aspect of life so, they should complement each other rather than outdoing one another.</p><br />\r\n<strong>Where the Concept of Feminism is Applicable? </strong><br />\r\n<p>However, the concept of Feminism is deep to understand wherein, it doesn’t pertain to the women power over men dominance nor it means the women overwhelming attitudes in each aspect. On the broader scenario, the term feminism is applicable or is suitable on the grounds where women are not treated well where they are essentially required to be treated healthy. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Different Feminism’s Believes Pertaining to Different Meanings & Values </strong><br />\r\n<p>In accordance to orthodox traditions, some people believe that women are the crown of the men’s head, some believe that the women should be valued and treated under footsteps, behind every successful men there is a women and there are ‘n’ number of believes which have their own concepts and meanings. In fact, such mythologies are not completely true and even most of them are not acceptable by the society. Each believe has its own meaning and thinking behind its existence.</p><br />\r\n<strong> How to Treat & to be Treated? </strong><br />\r\n<p>Therein, it doesn’t indicate that women should be treated like a void or like everything above. This is so because, there is an old saying that a coin has two faces the heads and the tail, similarly, the concept of feminism has. If a woman will be treated like a void, she would always feel underestimated and if she would be treated like everything above then, sometimes it becomes dominance to males. However, it is again based and varies from a person to person that how one treats and how the other person gets treated. </p><br />\r\n<strong>Feminism’s CLOSING THOUGHTS… </strong><br />\r\n<p>Henceforth, the most important truth in the life of both the genders is that our reproductive organs are different and clearly there is a reason that why only a woman carry the baby. On the other hand, it is also noticeable and obviously, it does not mean that the man cannot help out with the caring of the child. Father is as much a nurturer as the mother. So, I can say that people who understand feminism can easily understand that men and women are equal but have different roles to play.</p><br />\r\n ',	0,	0,	0,	10000,	2,	'2020-02-24 13:12:20',	'2020-03-02 12:50:27'),

This is because, healthy as well as the good eating habits leads towards the good, healthier, happier and a prosper life.

Do you know India contributes an additional 1,000,000 kids to its already high population every 20 days? With a growth rate of 20% per decade Indian population has deep and long-lasting repercussions. Indian has a population of 1.3 people currently, making it the second most populated country in the world. <br />\r\n<strong>Problems Due to Rising Population: </strong><br />\r\nThe food deficit, pollution and deteriorating sanitation and infrastructure to top the list. No matter how much the economic growth rate rises, the living standards do not raise at the same rate. In India, only <strong><em>\"only 6% of India\'s poor have access to tap water versus 33% of the non-poor.\"</em>  </strong>Sanitation till date remains a huge ongoing issue that the government is unable to address. Moreover, India has some of the most polluted cities in the world. <br />\r\n<strong>Two-Child Policy in India:</strong><br />\r\nBefore January 2020 India did not have a National Child policy. Thus family Planning Policies like Two-Child Policy comes as the need of the hour by the Indian Government. National Volunteer Organization (RSS) leader Mohan Bhagwat declared in January 2020 his organization\'s primary goal as a Two-Child Policy. The proposal is being criticized as an attempt to curtail the Indian Muslim Population. <br />\r\nIndia’s National Population Policy aims to stabilize India’s population by 2045. <br />\r\n<strong><em>\"A two-child policy is a government-imposed limit of two children allowe</em></strong><strong><em>d per </em></strong><strong><em>family, with the perks of government subsidies given only to the first two children.\"</em></strong><br />\r\nUnder the two-child policy - persons with more than two children would not be eligible to serve in government jobs. The act also called the Population Control Act, 2016 is applicable to all of India. As per the act, no person should procreate more than two living children after a period of one year from the commencement of the Act. <br />\r\nMany Indian states have adopted the two-child policy. It was Assam where the policy was most recently implemented in 2017. By 2017, 12 states had called for the two-child limitation for being eligible for a government job. The states are Odisha, Bihar, Chattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana. The policy has repealed by some of the states like Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Chattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. <br />\r\nAs per a report of the East Asia Forum India\'s population is projected to be 1.69 billion by 2050. It will make India\'s population higher than that of China.  Looking at the population prediction of India by 2050 the country may undergo a crisis situation. The demand for food and water will double up by 2050. India may be able to feed the growing population, however, may not be ecologically sustainable. Thus, the two-child policy is the most promising solution to the family planning initiative by the Indian Government. <br />\r\n#TwoChildPolicy #FamilyPlanningIndia #PopulationPolicy</span></span><br />\r\n <br />\r\n ',	0,	0,	0,	8000,	3,	'2020-03-20 22:10:05',	'2020-03-27 15:39:33'),
